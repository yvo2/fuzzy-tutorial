    "# Fuzzy Logic: General Overview and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuzzy Logic is a methodology predicated on the idea that the “truthiness” of something can be expressed over a continuum. This means that something isn’t simply true or false but instead partially true or partially false.\n",
    "\n",
    "A “good tip” might have a membership function with non-zero values between 15% and 25%, with 25% being a “completely good tip” (i.e., its membership is 1.0) and 15% being a “barely good tip” (i.e., its membership is 0.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "A fuzzy control system links fuzzy variables using a set of rules. These rules are simply mappings that describe how one or more fuzzy variables relate to another. These are expressed in an IF-THEN statement; the IF part is called the antecedent, and the THEN part is the consequent. In the tipping example, one rule might be “IF the service was good THEN the tip will be good.” The exact math related to how a rule is used to calculate the value of the consequent based on the value of the antecedent is outside the scope of this primer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Tipping Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the tipping example full circle, if we were to create a controller which estimates the tip we should give at a restaurant, we might structure it as such:\n",

    "## Antecedents (Inputs)\n",

    "  - **Universe** (i.e., crisp value range): How good was the service of the waitress, on a scale of 1 to 10?\n",
    "  - **Fuzzy set** (i.e., fuzzy value range): poor, acceptable, amazing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Food Quality**\n",
    "  - **Universe**: How tasty was the food, on a scale of 1 to 10?\n",
