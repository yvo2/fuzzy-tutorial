    "\n",
    "1. **If the dirtiness is poor OR the room size is small, then the cleaning intensity will be low.**\n",
    "2. **If the dirtiness is average AND the room size is medium, then the cleaning intensity will be medium.**\n",
    "3. **If the dirtiness is high OR the room size is large, then the cleaning intensity will be high.**\n",

    "These rules mirror how we would expect a robot vacuum to adjust its cleaning effort based on the condition of the room. However, the rules are inherently fuzzy—mapping these imprecise conditions into a well-defined cleaning intensity is where fuzzy logic excels. It helps bridge the gap between vague inputs and actionable cleaning strategies."
